goPromise
=========

goPromise is an implementation of Scheme's `delay` and `force` primitives for
the [Go](http://golang.org) programming language.

Installation
------------

Just run `goinstall golang.org/anschelsc/goPromise`, and then
`import promise "golang.org/anschelsc/goPromise"` to use it in your code.

Docs
----

The documentation, as is normal for Go packages, is in the code itself. If you
used `goinstall`, you should be able to use `godoc` to see the documentation,
e.g. with `godoc -http=:6060` and pointing your browser at
<http://localhost:6060>.
